            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>On the Job Training (OJT) is one of the mechanics of Higher Education industries in developing the needed competencies of its graduates. Its goals and objectives served as a guide in developing the needed competencies for a particular job, and translating the training into a gainful working experience.
                On the Job Training is one method by which students are exposed with different work station designed to give students an opportunity to experience and a chance to apply the theories and computation that they have learned from the school. It also helps the students to acquire relevant knowledge and skills by performing in actual work setting.
                On-the-Job training allows trainees to gain experience in situations very similar to those they’ll encounter on a daily basis. Trainees will use same tools and equipment they need for their job while being guided by an experience trainer.
                Corona Virus pandemic has affected all aspect of living. Even internships are either cancelled or move into online On-the-Job training. Though this set up has many disadvantages this also has an advantage to those students who can’t afford housing cost and other finances. They can have an internship within their household so they don’t have to go outside and expose their selves into the virus and preventing the spread of the virus.
                As one of the third year students undertaking the practicum subject as part of the curriculum in the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science course, I have been able to enter different kinds of webinars that helped in nurturing and enhance our knowledge and skills. With this knowledge I know I will be able to compete in my chosen field of specialization and future career after graduation. As a student trainee, I have been equipped by my intensive academic formation in my school, Surigao Del Sur State University, to be competent enough in pursuing different opportunities available for us in the world of the professionals and to be able to contribute and actively participate in the endeavours of actual work experience.</p>

        <div class="practicum-experience">
            <h1>Practicum Experience</h1>
            <p>My objective in this on-the-job training was to obtain a position where I can effectively apply my critical and analytical skills from my academic training experience as a computer science student that has interest in computer fields. Sadly we were not given the opportunity to apply our skills in this training because of the pandemic. Our dear school SDSSU came up of a new way to helps us maintain and enhance our knowledge we were task to attend webinars online that is in line with our taken course. Also this is a way to keep us safe and away from the virus.
                We started to take in webinars last July 5, 2021, and had a minimum of three webinars every week. After each webinar we would make a synthesis out of the webinars we attended and what we understood about it. We were checked by our programme handler about our progress and questions from time to time. And each one of us was expected to accomplish our task templates every week.
                During webinars I have to find a different spots for internet network because sometimes the internet is slow and hinder us to enter in the webinar, sometimes I freak out because I thought I’m out of the webinar but I was just out for a bit and will be back once the internet is back. There are times that I can’t understand the webinar because the audio is very low, so I have to end and enter the webinar again.</p>

        <div class="accomplishment">
            <h1>Accomplishments</h1>
            <p>I have gained certificates which I never dreamed I could ever have. It can be seen in my website. </p>
        </div>
        <hr />
        <div class="learning-experience">
            <h1>Learning Experience</h1>
            <p>I have gained further knowledge and skills with the helped of the webinars I had attended. I have also gained strategies and techniques in the IT world. The level of my creativity was also lift up and improved. <br />
                In this situation, I learned to be patient and resourceful. I learned that not everything we planned will go our way, sometimes let’s just trust the process and go with the flow of the situation. We just got to make sure we got the situation under control. Do not let others take you down.</p>

        <div class="impact-of-OJT">
            <h1>Impact of OJT</h1>
            <p>The on-the-job training experience I have, served as a motivation and helped me improve myself and become a better version of myself and as a student. The impact this training gave to me is that our right time will come we just have to fight and wait for it. We have to be ready every time, we have to witty and knowledgeable especially during interviews and exams. And in our future work we must have a good relationship with our colleagues to have a soft transaction in the company and a peaceful station.</p>
        </div>
        <hr />
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>The On-the-Job Training is indeed vital and necessary to students because the program expands our knowledge as it helps us explore our strengths and weaknesses in our tasks. It would have been better if it was performed in the actual working station but with the situation we are in right now it would be impossible. We just have to study harder and focus on studying than other things.
                The practicum experience is worth the time, effort and hard work. The times I have spent in those webinars contributed a lot to my knowledge and skills. The experience I had inspired me to always do well and always give my best in every work I have. <br />
                The experience increased my commitment and compassion as a student who will soon be part of the society of the professionals.</p>
